# Operational Code of Conduct

## Introduction: For Members

Welcome to the CVAOG, where passion for aviation meets a commitment to camaraderie and excellence. This manual outlines the core principles that guide our operations and interactions, ensuring a respectful, inclusive, and enjoyable experience for all members. Just as in any successful mission, teamwork, communication, and discipline are key to maintaining a positive environment where all can thrive.

Our goal is simple: to enhance the experience of flying together, support one another's growth, and foster a community built on mutual respect. Whether you're new to flight simulation or a seasoned pilot, these protocols serve as a framework for our shared journey.

Adhere to these guidelines, and you'll find not just a community, but a team dedicated to flying with purpose, enjoying the experience, and helping each other soar to new heights.

1. ### Have Fun

   1. The primary goal of this community is to have fun. This isn't a professional simulation or a side job. Whether flying or supporting operations, prioritize enjoyment for yourself and others. Actions and decisions should promote a fun, relaxed, and engaging environment for all participants.

   2. Attitude: Approach each session with a positive mindset, focusing on the fun aspects of teamwork and flying.

   3. Balance: While maintaining realism is appreciated, don't take things too seriously-laugh off mistakes and keep the mood light.

2. ### Respect

   1. Respect is a cornerstone of our community. Every member deserves to feel safe, valued, and respected.

   2. Zero Tolerance: Harassment, discrimination, offensive language, and aggressive behavior will not be tolerated. This includes in-game chat, voice communications, and any associated channels (forums, Discord, etc.).

   3. Constructive Feedback: Provide feedback in a constructive and respectful manner. Criticism should be aimed at improving skills, not tearing others down.

   4. Respect Boundaries: Be mindful of others' personal space and preferences, especially in voice channels and private communications.

3. ### No Childish Behavior

   1. Maintain a mature atmosphere. While fun is the focus, behavior that disrupts the experience of others, such as trolling or constant interruptions, will not be tolerated.

   2. Professionalism: Approach discussions and training sessions with a mature and cooperative attitude.

   3. Avoiding Disruptions: Immature antics, excessive distractions, and needlessly drawing attention to oneself can diminish the overall experience for everyone. This includes spamming irrelevant content in communication channels.

4. ### Communication

   1. Effective communication is vital for smooth operations and fun interactions.

   2. Relevant Channels: Use the appropriate channels for specific types of discussions (e.g., tactical discussion vs. general chatter). Memes, jokes, and off-topic content should be confined to designated areas.

   3. Clarity & Brevity: In mission-critical situations, ensure communications are clear, concise, and relevant. Avoid cluttering radio comms with unnecessary chatter.

   4. Help Requests: Don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification, but keep in mind the flow of the conversation.

5. ### Training Participation

   1. All members are welcome and encouraged to participate in training exercises, regardless of their experience or qualifications.

   2. Open Participation: Training sessions are available for all aircraft types. Pilots can learn new skills and improve on current ones at their own pace.

   3. Encouragement: More experienced members should encourage and mentor others, sharing knowledge and best practices during training.

   4. Growth: Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try different aircraft or roles within the team.

6. ### Aircraft Qualification

   1. Pilots must be qualified to operate any aircraft during official operations, but training is open to all.

   2. Qualification: To operate a specific aircraft during missions, members must complete a checkride and pass the necessary tests.

   3. Prioritization: Aircraft slots in missions may be limited and will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. Regular pilots of specific aircraft will have priority when slots are limited, but new pilots should also be given opportunities.

   4. Cross-Training: Members are encouraged to broaden their qualifications by learning multiple aircraft, which enhances team flexibility during missions.

7. ### Inclusivity

   1. We strive to create an environment where everyone feels included, regardless of their background or experience level.

   2. Welcoming Environment: Newcomers and veterans alike should feel welcome. Encourage interaction, learning, and collaboration in all activities.

   3. Diversity: We celebrate the diversity of our community. Everyone's voice matters, and different perspectives enhance our shared experience.

   4. No Exclusion: Ensure no one feels left out of missions, training sessions, or social activities.

8. ### Support Each Other

   1. Teamwork is the foundation of our operations. By working together and supporting each other, we all grow stronger.

   2. Mentorship: More experienced pilots and crew members are encouraged to offer mentorship to those learning new roles or aircraft.

   3. Collaboration: Collaboration is key, both in and out of the cockpit. Share insights, strategies, and tips to help improve the overall skill level of the community.

   4. Problem Solving: Work together to solve issues during training or missions, whether it's technical difficulties, mission planning, or in-flight complications.

9. ### Enjoy the Experience

   1. Always remember that we're here to enjoy the experience of flying and working as a team.

   2. Positive Reinforcement: Celebrate victories and accomplishments, no matter how small.

   3. Learning from Mistakes: Mistakes are part of the learning process-embrace them and use them as opportunities for growth.

   4. Savor the Journey: The thrill of flying, the camaraderie of working with a team, and the joy of learning new things are at the heart of our community. Keep this in mind in everything you do.

## Conclusion: Commitment to Excellence

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that our community remains a place of fun, growth, and mutual respect. Each member plays a vital role in upholding the standards of professionalism, teamwork, and inclusivity. Whether you're in training, on a mission, or simply engaging with the group, remember that we are united by a shared passion for flight and the camaraderie that comes with it.

Our strength lies in our collective dedication to improving our skills, supporting one another, and maintaining a positive, respectful environment. As we continue to grow, let us uphold these principles and remain committed to excellence in all that we do.

Fly with purpose. Support your team. Enjoy the journey.
